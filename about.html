                I am passionate about frontend web development and page design and am also enhancing my 
                programming skills. I have a strong interest in marketing and am exploring opportunities 
                in that field. I am open to pursuing any of these areas based on available opportunities.
                Additionally, I am eager to move abroad to gain more experience and build valuable connections.
                My adaptability and quick learning will help me thrive in new environments and roles.

            <h1 class="title">More About Me:</h1>
            <p class="description">
                My journey has given me the ability to connect with people and adapt quickly to new environments.
                Changing schools around 7 times from kindergarten has strengthened my skills in blending into diverse 
                settings and building relationships with ease. I excel in planning, teamwork, and communication, which
                enhance my projects and professional interactions. While time management is a challenge I'm actively improving, 
                I'm dedicated to developing better strategies and am confident in overcoming this challenge.

                to music helps me unwind and relax, providing comfort and a creative escape from daily routines.
