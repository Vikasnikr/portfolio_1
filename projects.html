              <b>Project Overview:</b> 
                 This is a frontend project,a weather app
                 that detects and displays real-time weather conditions worldwide. This project is
                 a clone, and I gave it my best shot on my first attempt.<br>
           </p>
            <p class="description">
                <b>Technologies Used:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="description">
                <b>Features:</b><br>
                <b>Real-Time Weather:</b>
                   Fetches and displays current weather conditions using an API key from a weather API.<br>

                <b>Default Location:</b> 
                   The app is set to display weather details for Coimbatore by default.<br>

                <b>Search Functionality:</b> 
                   Users can search for any location, and the app will display the respective weather details.
                   If the location is not found, an error message "City not found" is shown.<br>

                <b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> 
                   Includes a home page with a few pre-set locations and
                   displays the current date and time, as well as the temperature in Celsius.<br>

                <b>Error Handling:</b> 
                   If the search bar is left empty, the app prompts with "Please type a city name.
                  "Upon refreshing the page, it reverts to showing the weather conditions of the default location.<br>
            </p>

                <b>Learning Experience:</b>
                  This front-end project allowed me to explore the integration of APIs with JavaScript and improve my skills 
                  in HTML and CSS design. It's a foundational step in my journey as a web developer.<br>

                  (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project started as a clone of an existing bookstore application,
                  but I made significant modifications to enhance its functionality and design. It allows users to create an account 
                  explore the courses and send a message to the store.<br>
